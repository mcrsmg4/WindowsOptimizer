---

## Installation

WindowsOptimizer is distributed as a ZIP file containing the batch wrapper and embedded PowerShell script.

### Download

- Grab the latest release ZIP from the [Releases page](https://github.com/mcrsmg4/WindowsOptimizer/releases)  
- Extract anywhere convenient on your Windows machine

### Requirements

- Windows 10 or later  
- PowerShell 5.1 or higher (built-in on Windows 10+)  
- Internet connection for app installs (Chocolatey/Winget)

### Running

Double-click the `WindowsOptimizer.bat` file to launch the GUI. The script handles elevation and runs the embedded PowerShell script automatically.

---

## Usage

1. Launch `WindowsOptimizer.bat` (requires admin privileges).  
2. In the GUI window, check the tweaks and applications you want to apply/install.  
3. Click **Apply Tweaks + Install**.  
4. The script will run with elevated permissions and display progress.  
5. Upon completion, a pause will let you review any output or errors.  
6. Close the window when done.

## How It Works

WindowsOptimizer leverages a batch file wrapper to create and run a temporary PowerShell script:

- The batch file generates a PowerShell script dynamically in the temp folder.  
- This PowerShell script builds a Windows Forms GUI with checkbox options.  
- On confirmation, it runs system tweaks via registry and service modifications.  
- It checks for Chocolatey and installs it if necessary, then installs selected apps using Chocolatey or Winget.  
- The batch file ensures the process runs with full administrator privileges and handles elevation prompts.

This hybrid approach balances ease of distribution (batch wrapper) with powerful scripting capabilities (PowerShell).

---

## Configuration & Customization

Developers and power users can customize or extend WindowsOptimizer by editing the PowerShell script:

- Modify or add apps in the `$apps` array  
- Change registry tweaks or add new ones inside the elevated `Start-Process` block  
- Adjust GUI layout or button behavior within the form creation code  
- Enable logging by redirecting output to a file for troubleshooting  
- Integrate new package managers or add custom install commands

> **Note:** To contribute, clone the repo, edit the PowerShell script, and test thoroughly before submitting pull requests.

## Command Line Options

Currently, WindowsOptimizer does not support command line arguments but contributions to add this feature are welcome!

Planned features may include:

- Silent mode for automated scripting  
- Selection of specific tweaks or apps via CLI  
- Output logging and error reporting options

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Script fails to run:** Ensure you launch the batch file with administrator privileges.  
- **PowerShell execution policy errors:** The script sets policy bypass temporarily but check if your system policy restricts it.  
- **Chocolatey not installing:** Verify internet connectivity and unblock script execution.  
- **App installs failing:** Check if Winget or Chocolatey commands run manually on your system.  
- **UI not appearing:** Confirm PowerShell version and Windows Forms assemblies are available.
